# Health Tracker

The Health Tracker is a Python Script that helps you calculate your Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR) and daily caloric intake based on various factors like age, gender, weight, height, body fat percentage, and fitness goals. Whether you're looking to maintain, gain, or lose weight, this program provides you with valuable insights into your daily caloric requirements.

## How to Use

1. **Download**: Clone or download the repository to your local machine.

2. **Navigate to the Directory**: Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory containing the downloaded files.

3. **Run the Program**: Enter the following command to run the program:

python health_tracker.py

4. **Follow the Prompts**: The program will guide you through a series of prompts to gather information about you and your goals. You will be asked to provide details such as age, gender, weight, height, body fat percentage (optional), fitness goals, and more.

5. **Input Information**: Input the requested information as prompted. For numeric inputs, you'll need to enter valid numbers within the specified ranges. For yes/no choices, input 'Y' or 'N' accordingly.

6. **View Results**: After providing all the required information, the program will calculate and display your Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR), recommend daily caloric intake, and, if applicable, goal-specific caloric intake.

## Inputs and Outputs

- **Age**: Enter your age in years.
- **Gender**: Enter 'M' for male or 'F' for female.
- **Weight**: Enter your weight in kilograms.
- **Height**: Enter your height in meters.
- **Body Fat Percentage (Optional)**: Enter your body fat percentage, if known.
- **Fitness Goals**: Choose whether you have a specific goal weight and time frame in mind.
- **Goal Weight (Optional)**: If you have a goal weight, enter it in kilograms.
- **Goal Time (Optional)**: If you have a goal time in days, enter it.
- **Goal Knowledge**: Indicate whether you know your fitness goal.

The program will then provide you with your BMR, daily caloric intake recommendation, and, if applicable, goal-specific caloric intake.

## Important Notes

- The program provides general estimates and recommendations. Consult a healthcare professional or nutritionist for personalized advice.
- Ensure that the input values are accurate to receive meaningful results.
- If you don't know your body fat percentage or fitness goals, the program can still provide recommendations based on your age, gender, and height.
- Always remember to prioritize healthy and sustainable lifestyle changes.
